Instead of memorizing the numbers, you should understand the categories of status codes. This is the most practical way to handle them.

1xx (Informational): The request has been received, and the process is continuing.

2xx (Success): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. A 200 OK is in this category.

3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.

4xx (Client Error): The client (your program) made a mistake. A 404 Not Found or a 400 Bad Request are in this category.

5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill a valid request. A 500 Internal Server Error is in this category.

By knowing these categories, you can quickly diagnose whether an issue is on your end or the server's.
